# 👋🏽 Hello

<div class="home-container">

  <div class="home-content">

I'm Harish — but you might stumble across `@harishsambasivam` in some corners of the internet. I spend most of my time building backend systems, thinking about scale, observability, and the calm beauty of well-architected infrastructure.

I like to [tinker](https://github.com/harishsambasivam) with distributed systems, monitoring, and the occasional side projects that makes me think.

Outside of work, I’m happiest with soil on my hands — a natural farming enthusiast trying to grow slow and steady in my backyard garden. I’m learning the flute, one breath at a day 😂, and I love getting around on my cycle 🚲. Most evenings, you’ll find me on the Kollidam river bridge, watching fishermen work and birds 🦢 drift by. It’s where things feel still — and full of life.
