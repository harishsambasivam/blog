# 👋🏽 Hello

<div class="home-container">

  <div class="home-content">

I'm Harish — but you might stumble across `@harishsambasivam` in some corners of the internet. I'm a backend engineer with experience building product features for B2B, SaaS companies. Currently, I'm building a GRC platform at Scrut.io, where I focus on scalable backend systems and infrastructure.

I like working on distributed systems, monitoring, and enjoy learning through side projects.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me in my small backyard garden, trying to learn the flute, or cycling around village. I love spending quiet evenings and sometimes mornings by the nearby river #riverside #stories, watching the fishermen and birds go about their day.
